# house-prices-kaggle
my second Kaggle competition

This is my notebook for the Kaggle competition **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**. The goal was to predict house prices with up to 79 explanatory variables. I used the methods *gradient boosting* and *lasso regression* as well as the modules *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *sklearn*, and *scipy*.
